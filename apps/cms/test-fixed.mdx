## Background

Authenticity in the art world is traditionally supported through certificates, expert opinions, and provenance documentation. While these methods establish origin, they often lack persistent physical evidence that reflects the artwork's real condition over time.

Condition reporting has long been used for insurance and transport purposes. This case study reframes condition reporting as an authenticity reinforcement system that documents the physical reality of an artwork across its lifecycle.

## Problem Statement

Current authenticity practices face several limitations.

- Certificates are static and can exist independently from the artwork
- Provenance records rarely include detailed physical verification
- Artwork substitution or alteration may go unnoticed
- Disputes between damage and original characteristics are common

There is a need for a system that anchors authenticity to structured physical evidence captured at multiple points in time.

## Approach

The system introduces structured inspections at key lifecycle moments:

- Pre-transport
- Post-installation
- Post-exhibition
- Pre-sale
- Post-acquisition

Each inspection captures the following:

- Standardized condition categories
- Severity ratings
- Free-text observations
- Annotated high-resolution images
- Inspector identity and timestamp

Once finalized, records are versioned and cannot be altered.

## Condition History Accumulation

As condition reports accumulate, authenticity confidence increases through repeatable physical verification.

## Findings

### Physical fingerprints are difficult to replicate

Surface texture, wear patterns, craquelure, and frame imperfections create a unique physical identity for each artwork that is extremely hard to forge.

### Time-stamped records strengthen provenance

Each condition report confirms the artwork's existence and state at a specific moment, reinforcing provenance with physical evidence.

### Substitution attempts become detectable

Even small mismatches between reports reveal inconsistencies that raise authenticity concerns.

### Certificates gain supporting evidence

Condition history transforms certificates of authenticity from standalone claims into evidence-backed records.

## Results

The prototype demonstrated measurable improvements in authenticity verification and trust:

- Clear lifecycle traceability
- Reduced authenticity disputes
- Improved buyer confidence during resale
- Better distinction between damage and original characteristics

## Key Metrics

Pilot evaluation using simulated gallery workflows produced the following results:

- Average inspection completion time was 12 minutes
- Image annotation accuracy improved by 35% compared to text-only reports
- Artwork substitution attempts were detected in all test cases
- Gallery professional confidence rating averaged 4.6 out of 5

## Conclusion

This case study demonstrates that artwork condition reporting can significantly improve authenticity when treated as a continuous verification system rather than a one-time administrative document. By tying authenticity to physical evidence and time-stamped inspections, condition reporting strengthens trust across the art ecosystem.

This is a developing case study. Future work includes live gallery pilots, NFC-based object linking, and long-term condition data analysis across collections.
