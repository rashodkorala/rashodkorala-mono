# Photos Storage Bucket

Set up Supabase Storage for photo uploads.

## Overview

The photos storage bucket stores uploaded image files. It's configured as a public bucket so images can be accessed via public URLs.

## Create Bucket via SQL

Run this SQL script in your Supabase SQL Editor:

<CodeBlock language="sql" filename="database-storage-photos-bucket.sql">
{`-- Create photos bucket
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public, file_size_limit, allowed_mime_types)
VALUES (
  'photos',
  'photos',
  true, -- Public bucket
  10485760, -- 10MB file size limit
  ARRAY['image/jpeg', 'image/png', 'image/webp', 'image/gif']
)
ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;

-- Drop existing policies if they exist
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can upload photos" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own photos" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete their own photos" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Public can view photos" ON storage.objects;

-- Create storage policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload photos"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'photos');

CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own photos"
ON storage.objects FOR UPDATE
TO authenticated
USING (bucket_id = 'photos')
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'photos');

CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own photos"
ON storage.objects FOR DELETE
TO authenticated
USING (bucket_id = 'photos');

CREATE POLICY "Public can view photos"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
TO public
USING (bucket_id = 'photos');`}
</CodeBlock>

## Create Bucket Manually

Alternatively, create the bucket in Supabase Dashboard:

1. Go to **Supabase Dashboard → Storage**
2. Click **"Create a new bucket"**
3. Name it `photos`
4. Make it **Public**
5. Set file size limit to **10MB**
6. Run the SQL policies above to set up access
