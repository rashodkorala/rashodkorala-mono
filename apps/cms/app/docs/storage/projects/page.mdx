# Projects Storage Bucket

Set up Supabase Storage for project image uploads.

## Overview

The projects storage bucket stores uploaded project images. It's configured as a public bucket so images can be accessed via public URLs.

## Create Bucket via SQL

Run this SQL script in your Supabase SQL Editor:

<CodeBlock language="sql" filename="database-storage-projects-bucket.sql">
{`-- Create projects bucket
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public, file_size_limit, allowed_mime_types)
VALUES (
  'projects',
  'projects',
  true, -- Public bucket
  10485760, -- 10MB file size limit
  ARRAY['image/jpeg', 'image/png', 'image/webp', 'image/gif']
)
ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;

-- Drop existing policies if they exist
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can upload project images" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own project images" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete their own project images" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Public can view project images" ON storage.objects;

-- Create storage policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload project images"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'projects');

CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own project images"
ON storage.objects FOR UPDATE
TO authenticated
USING (bucket_id = 'projects')
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'projects');

CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own project images"
ON storage.objects FOR DELETE
TO authenticated
USING (bucket_id = 'projects');

CREATE POLICY "Public can view project images"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
TO public
USING (bucket_id = 'projects');`}
</CodeBlock>
